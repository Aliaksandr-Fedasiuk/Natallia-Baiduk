To run an app with required options, need to use the next line:

-Xss2M -Xmx1024M -XX:SurvivorRatio=5

Note: the requirement to set the heap structure like this: 5-Eden,2-S0,4-S1 - is incorrect,
because S0 and S1 should have the same size. To set size for the Survivors I've used -XX:SurvivorRatio=5,
it means that each Survivor space will be 1/5 of Eden (S0:S1:Eden - 1:1:5).

The reason of the error is next:

a big byte array is created in a cycle, after creation it is added to arrayList,
so that the link to the byte array always exists and GC isn't touched it.
After some time (depends of VM options) an OutOfMemory exception appears.
I've used the jvisualvm to ensure in the reason.
I've pushed the array creation out of the cycle to avoid the exception.

Please, see MemoryEaterFixed.java.
